      <p>I'm Lincoln Wisely. I live in St. Louis with my fiance, Arin, and <a href="http://lincolnwisely.com/dog-toggle.html" target="_blank">our two dogs</a>. More on <a href="about.php">the personal stuff here</a>. This site is the first I designed and built from ground up to nurture my front-end development skills. As I keep learning, I'll gradually expand the depth and features of this site. Hooray!</p>
