<!--
      <p>When I  graduated from college in 2011, Borders, the bookstore retailer, was frantically marking down prices to move merchandise from hundreds of closing stores. To most, it was business. To me, it was personal. Borders served as the backdrop of some of the most profound moments in my personal coming-of-age story. Other than the library, it was my trusted go-to literary haven and study hall. It felt local to me, even though it wasn't. So it was a heavy feeling, walking through the disheveled aisles that had been picked apart by the masses before me. I managed to take advantage of the sale myself; after all, I was a recent grad with emotional baggage, looming student loan debt. I needed distractions. Included in the stack of works I clutched under my arm was a book called The Accidental Creative. It was in the Business section (because I was so grown up) and it was supposed to teach me how to be brilliant on a whim. I'll be honest, I haven't retained much from the read. I really haven't. Except for one phrase that has echoed in my mind for years: If you're not growing, you're dying. </p>

      <br>
      <p>If you're not growing, you're dying. And I'm trying to grow here. Trying to earn my "edge" back, test my comfort zone, evade dormancy â€“ all that stuff.</p>
      <br> -->

      <p>When I'm not overthinking my life trajectory, I invest my time and energy on the two things I love the most: My girlfriend, Arin, and my dogs, Tony and Vince. I like trying new restaurants (and reveling in old favorites), traveling, taking photos, listening to music, watching movies, sipping whiskey, sipping tea, reading books, learning new things and curbing my perpetual sweet tooth. I'm reserved, creative, neurotic and curious.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Many people know my by the name Emily, but I prefer Lincoln. </p>
