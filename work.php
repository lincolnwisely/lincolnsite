        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p >I earned a BA in advertising with an emphasis in graphic design from Harding University in 2011. With skills in copywriting, design, social media and HTML/CSS,
      my professional roles have teetered on both client and agency sides. </p>

        <h3>Copywriting</h3>
          <p>My lifelong love for literature has no doubt fueled a strong passion and interest
        in copywriting. My past work has included: Brand guidelines, B2B and B2C
        resources (Healthcare, Construction, Finance, SEO/PPC), case studies, social media
        content, blog posts, press releases, newsletters, drip email campaigns and more.</p>


      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>I’m currently a student of web development, and this site right here is the first I’ve
      actually designed and deployed. My <a href="http://webberwisely.com">wedding website</a> is another one in the works. But thanks to the brilliant organization <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/coder_girl" target="_blank">CoderGirl</a>, one
      of many initiatives from <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>, I’m quickly deepening my abilities and
      confidence. Here are a couple more <em>simple</em> projects: <a href="http://lincolnwisely.com/make-more-exciting.html" target="_blank">Make More Exciting</a> and <a href="http://lincolnwisely.com/dog-toggle.html" target="_blank">Dog Toggle</a>. </p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>From banner ads to custom white papers layouts, my professional design
        background is strongly tied to digital marketing. I also have experience with package
        design, logo creation, brochures, brand standards, photography, infographics and
        wireframe design.</p>
